Interview Preparation - Picnic Business Analyst

1. Presentation - Tell Me About Yourself

Hello, my name is Pietro Gazzi, and I am an engineer with a strong background in data analysis, 
problem-solving, and leveraging technology to drive business decisions. I hold a Master’s degree 
in Mechanical Engineering and Space Engineering, and I have 3 years of experience working as a data 
analyst in fast-paced environments. My expertise lies in using SQL and Python to analyze data, 
identify trends, and develop strategies that drive business impact. 

I have had the opportunity to work in various countries and industries, which has enriched my 
professional experience and adaptability. In Italy, I worked at Leonardo Helicopters, where I 
developed SQL-based dashboards in Power BI, reducing repair turnaround time by 15% and increasing 
operational efficiency. In France, I served as a Research Engineer at the Institut Polytechnique de 
Paris, focusing on experimental and numerical analysis of crack propagation in 3D printed 
Polycarbonate.

These diverse roles have honed my ability to solve complex problems and use data to drive innovation 
and improve decision-making processes. I am passionate about leveraging my technical skills and 
analytical mindset to make a tangible impact on business outcomes.

I am particularly drawn to Picnic’s data-driven approach, international expansion, and culture of 
innovation. I want to be part of a company that challenges the status quo and continuously improves 
the online grocery experience. My goal is to contribute by optimizing decision-making through 
analytics, automating processes, and identifying strategic opportunities to drive growth.

This role aligns with my ambition to work in a dynamic environment where I can apply my technical 
expertise while also developing strategic thinking. I am eager to take ownership of impactful 
projects and work with a team that values innovation and efficiency.

2. Entrepreneurial Spirit

Project 1: Optimizing Helicopter Repair Data Management (STAR Method)

Situation: In my current role at Leonardo Helicopters, I identified inefficiencies in the way 
helicopter repair data was being managed. The existing system made it difficult to track repair 
status and analyze trends.

Task: My objective was to create a structured data framework to improve accessibility and 
decision-making.

Action: I designed and implemented a Power BI dashboard connected to a PostgreSQL database, which 
automated reporting and provided real-time insights on repair cycles and failure rates.

Result: The solution reduced data retrieval time by 60%, improved issue tracking, and helped 
management make faster, data-driven decisions, ultimately reducing repair lead times.

Backup Project: Customer Relationship Management (CRM) System (STAR Method)

Situation: I collaborated extensively with engineers working on the CRM system in my company. 
As a personal project, I decided to develop a CRM system to better understand the process, 
complications, and development points.

Task: My objective was to create an integrated system that provides valuable insights for 
improving customer relationships and business strategies.

Action: I designed and implemented a CRM system using PostgreSQL, Python, and Power BI. 
The system automated data management, provided real-time insights, and facilitated better 
decision-making.

Result: The CRM system improved data accessibility, enhanced customer relationship management, 
and provided actionable insights that could be used to drive business growth.
