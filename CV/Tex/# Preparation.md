# Sample Answers

1. **Tell me about yourself:**
   I hold a Master’s degree in Mechanical Engineering and Space Engineering, and I have 3 years of experience working as a data analyst in fast-paced environments. My expertise lies in using SQL and Python to analyze data, identify trends, and develop strategies that drive business impact. In my previous role at Leonardo Helicopters, I developed SQL-based dashboards in Power BI, which reduced repair turnaround time by 15% and increased operational efficiency. I am passionate about solving complex problems and using data to drive innovation and improve decision-making processes.

2. **Why do you want to work at Picnic?**
   I am excited about the opportunity to work at Picnic because of your commitment to innovation and data-driven decision-making.
