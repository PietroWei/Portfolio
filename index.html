       <h2>About me</h2>
        <div class="about-section">
            <p><strong>Educational Background:</strong> I hold a <strong>Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering</strong> and a <strong>Master's Degree in Space Engineering</strong>, which have provided me with a solid foundation in problem-solving and analytical thinking. Over the years, I have further refined my expertise through certifications in <strong>Data Science</strong>, <strong>Machine Learning</strong>, and <strong>Finance</strong>, all of which have enabled me to transition into the world of business/data analysis.</p>

            <p><strong>Motivation:</strong> My journey into data analysis was fueled by a strong curiosity and a desire to understand the stories hidden within data. With a deep interest in data exploration, problem-solving, and innovation, I am passionate about using data to uncover insights that can drive meaningful change and improve decision-making processes.</p>

            <p><strong>Core Skills:</strong> I have developed a diverse skill set, including <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>SQL</strong>, <strong>PostgreSQL</strong>, and various <strong>machine learning</strong> and <strong>statistical analysis</strong> techniques. My work experience spans <strong>research analysis</strong>, where I conducted experimental data analysis, and my current role as a <strong>repair engineer</strong> at <strong>Leonardo Helicopters</strong>. In my previous role as a researcher in fracture mechanics, I specialized in numerical modeling and experimental analysis, managing extensive data and images. Currently, I apply data-driven solutions to optimize repair workflows and improve operational efficiency.</p>

            <p><strong>Professional Skills:</strong> In addition to my technical abilities, I bring strong <strong>problem-solving</strong> and <strong>critical thinking</strong> skills to every project. I believe in approaching challenges logically, diving deep into the data to extract meaningful insights that help drive better decisions.</p>

            <p><strong>Continuous Learning:</strong> I am committed to staying ahead of industry trends, constantly learning new tools and methodologies to improve my analysis. Whether it’s through following industry blogs, attending webinars, or taking new certifications, I ensure my skills remain sharp and relevant to the ever-evolving data landscape.</p>

            <p><strong>Motivation and Drive:</strong> Ultimately, what drives me is the opportunity to turn raw data into valuable insights that make a tangible impact on the business. I thrive on the challenge of understanding complex data and delivering clear, actionable insights that inform decision-making and foster innovation.</p>

            <p><strong>Personal Interests:</strong> Fueled by passion and determination, I am a dedicated supporter of Fiorentina. My love for the team runs deep, and I never miss a match. In addition to my enthusiasm for football, I am also an avid marathon runner. I take great pride in having completed a marathon in 2 hours and 55 minutes, a testament to my commitment and perseverance.</p>
